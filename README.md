# Bus-mall

## this lab was so good and challenging to do it and the next steps will discuss about the lab tasks :

* Make a page for view three images at the same time when we click on any image and just on the image border in the page.

* After clicks 25 times the results will appear as un-order list with the number of clicks and views of images.

* Make the page appear three different images for the one click on it, then prevent subsequent images from similarity in  the second iteration from the first iteration.

*  Make the results of the number of clicks and views appear as a bar chart by using the chart.js.
